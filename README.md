This is a concise list of my best computer science and engineering projects with source code and documentation.
For testing the Java projects, IntelliJ IDEA will be required.
For testing the STM32 project, STM32CubeIDE will be required.
For the UNIX C projects, a UNIX based system (e.g. Ubuntu) will be required.
