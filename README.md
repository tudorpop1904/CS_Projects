This is a concise list of my best computer science and engineering projects with source code and documentation.
For testing the Java projects, IntelliJ IDEA (or a similar Java IDE) will be required.
For testing the STM32 project, STM32CubeIDE, as well as original STMicroelectronics hardware (a STM32L496G-DISCO board), breadboards, wires, and an LM35 temperature sensor will be required.
For the UNIX C projects, a UNIX based system (e.g. Ubuntu) will be required.
